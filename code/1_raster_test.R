## Chess board equivalent representation in raster
## Inspect the raster object and think about how we could combine them for masking multi-piece patterns
## https://rdrr.io/cran/raster/man/raster-package.html
## https://rspatial.org/raster/pkg/2-classes.html

## raster is a virtual class, with inheriting classes RasterLayer, RasterStack, RasterBrick
## So multi-variable chess data-structure, we can conceive of a raster object manipulated for actual implementation of gameplay.
## No reinventing the wheel, we should probably use bigchess to keep the gamestate in a PGN format.
## Hopefully from this state we can make a fast way to derive the initial raster representation from PGN and
## methods on the raster class will manage updating positions and derived features.
## with a raster layer as a basic unit for 8x8 one-hot parameter encoding of some relationship of interest
## we can maintain a number of human-interpretable "positional' views of gamestate possibilities.
  ## Given that I must make a move, out of my possible moves, 
  ## what do I think about the opportunities that will create for me and my opponent?
  ## Ideally reinforcement learning through self-play would be used,
  ## and we can observe if it plays like a human, given our instantiation of an axiomatic human strategy.

# 1 ------- INITIAL VIEW OF RASTER OBJECT
## We want to parameterize the model to be able to pick up on patterns in the pieces.
## ML on raster states throughout the game is the idea. 

board <- raster(xmn = 0, xmx = 8, 
               ymn = 0, ymx = 8, 
               nrows = 8, ncols = 8)

board[] = 1:64
plot(board)


# 2 -------- MATRIX REPRESENTATIONS OF CHESS BOARD

## start with {a1, b1, ..., a8, b8, ..., g8, h8}
## must be careful about how we set up matrix notation
board_positions = outer(letters[1:8], 1:8, FUN = paste0)
str(list(board_positions))

## Natural outer product orientation is not chess orientation
board_positions

## Transpose + horizontal flip to get white position from outer product
t(outer(letters[1:8], 8:1, FUN = paste0))

## This is white's view of the board.
## These combined traansform the natural index to white's view.
white_matrix =  t(outer(letters[1:8], 8:1, FUN = paste0))

## black's view of the board is a 180 degree rotation, just rev()
black_matrix = matrix(rev(white_matrix), nrow = 8)

## Chess indexing differs from natural matrix indexing (low -> high directions)
## With matrices, indexes increase as you go down/right
## Since positions are referred to as "file-rank", 
## use that to define a natural "row-column" coordinates
## I will align this with a 1-64 index based on default matrix() by-column ordering.
## Define other index conventions in terms of the natural matrix convention

natural_matrix = matrix(outer(letters[1:8], 1:8, FUN = paste0), nrow = 8)
natural_matrix
natural_index = as.character(natural_matrix)
natural_index


## Lets make an object to have tidy indices
ind_table = data.table(pos = natural_index)
ind_table[, c("file", "rank") := tstrsplit(pos,"")]

ind_table[, natural := lapply(pos, function(x) {which(natural_index == x)})]

head(ind_table)

ind_table[, white := sapply(pos,
                            function(x) {which(white_matrix == x)})]
head(ind_table)

## Verifying mapping: the matrix defined by the order of white indices matches the white matrix
identical(matrix(ind_table[order(white),pos], nrow = 8), white_matrix)

ind_table[, black := sapply(pos,
                            function(x) {which(black_matrix == x)})]

identical(matrix(ind_table[order(black),pos], nrow = 8), black_matrix)

## Helper functions for translating character positions

}

get_black <- function(chr) {
  return(as.numeric(ind_table[pos == chr, black]))
}

get_natural("a8")
get_white("a8")
get_black("a8")

## Helper function to generate positions based on numeric equivalent
## A-H = 1-8 for file, 1-8 for rank (i.e., white perspective)
chr_pos <- function(file, rank) {
  return(paste0(letters[file], rank))
}
chr_pos(2,2)

## Position encoder - make a matrix with indicator at one index
get_matrix <- function(indx) {
  tmp = matrix(rep(0,64), nrow = 8)
  tmp[indx] = 1
  return(tmp)
}

## Ta-da!
get_matrix(get_white("a1")) ## White's view of a1
get_matrix(get_black("a1")) ## Black's view of a1
get_matrix(get_white(chr_pos(5,4))) ## white's view of the 5th-file, 4th rank (e4)
get_matrix(get_natural("a5")) ## a5 in natural index view

## Ok -- now what would a chess state look like?
## We are using this structure to represent each piece's possibilities in an easy-to-work-with way
## Intuition, build a raster layer for each individual piece. Initialize a starting board state

## For simplicity, I would like the raster to store objects in the natural matrix indexing
### Why: easy intuitive lookup for positions, f7 is the 6th letter 7th number, 
###       so 6th row 7th column would follow our matrix intuitions for order of providing coordinates.
## and when accessing, I can mask with white/black POV.

## What all would we need to full define a starting state?
## More helpers first
